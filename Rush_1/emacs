;; To make a file-header, download the files header2.el and lib-requires.el then put them in your .emacs.d
;; Add the .d to the load path of emacs, enable the header and set your own command with the following lines :

(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/")
(autoload 'make-header "header2")
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c h") 'make-header)

;; To modify the header, directly modify the code in header2.el.
